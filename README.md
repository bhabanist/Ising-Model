# Ising-Model
This is a code for 2 dimensional ising Model which i have used for my project. Note that in my project i used non-zero external Magnetic field
so it wont give you second order phase transition rather a new phenomena called crossover phenomena. Where order parameter varies very slowly and it goes to
new phase without giving discontinuity in your thermodynamic quantities like specific heat and Susceptibiliity.
